runZero virtual appliance
-------------------------

Credentials:

Virtual machine hardware settings:

    The OVA is preconfigured to:
        Processor: 4 CPU cores
        Memory: 32GiB 
        Storage: Up to 1 TiB

    This meets the minimum recommended production requirements for the console. 
    These should be edited as needed for deployment. recommended production requirements are:

        Processor: 12+ CPU cores at 2GHz or faster
        Memory: 128GiB 
        Storage: 1 TiB+

Notes on runZero Platform (console):

    The runZero platform is configured to run in 'offline' mode by default.
    To change this behavior change the line 'OFFLINE=true' in /etc/rumble/config
    to 'OFFLINE=false' and run 'sudo rumblectl restart'.

Notes on initial_setup.sh shell script:

    This script will handle all actions related to new IP assignment of the deployed 
    image including modifying necessary config files, generating TLS keys, and restarting
    services. The script will prompt for whether the virtual machine will receive an IP via 
    DHCP or not and, if not, prompt for the IP and subnet mask that should be assigned in CIDR
    notation format e.g. 192.168.1.10/24


Notes on SSH key regeneration:

    The VM has a systemD service running that will generate new SSH host keys
    when the OVA image is started for the first time, afterwhich, it diables itself.

    If it is more desirable to have SSH keys regenerated at each system restart then
    edit /etc/systemd/system/ssh_hostkey_regen.service and remove this line under the [service]
    section:

        ExecStartPost=/bin/systemctl disable ssh_hostkey_regen
 
    Then run 'sudo systemctl enable ssh_hostkey_regen'
